### Conversations with GPT-4o on JAX technicalities

(On JAX immutable tree optimization and random initialization intricacies,
see also **Random numbers** section in **JAX - The Sharp Bits**, 
https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html)

[tree_init_prototype.py](tree_init_prototype.py) - a very nice LLM-generated prototype for
tree initialization with random leaves in JAX (that's what I would do too, compute
how many leaves are there, generate all the keys required by JAX way to generate
random numbers, and then use them all to initialize leaves, and then
unflatten the structure back into tree, avoiding any tree traversal and any complex logic)

For optimization of these weights it suggests using https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax library.

>To optimize the values in the tree, you can use JAX's `jax.grad` or `jax.value_and_grad` to compute gradients
>with respect to the loss function, and `jax.tree_util.tree_map` to apply updates to the tree structure.

[tree_optimization_prototype.py](tree_optimization_prototype.py) - LLM-generated prototype (one needs to replace
the optimizer with Adam, among other changes)

> **Key Points to Remember:**
>
> 1. **Random Number Generation:** Always pass the rng_key explicitly to functions that generate random numbers. This ensures reproducibility.
> 2. **Immutability:** JAX data structures are immutable, so updates return new versions of the structures rather than modifying them in place.
> 3. **Tree Structures:** Use `jax.tree_util` utilities to handle tree-like structures effectively, both for initialization and optimization.
>
> By following these steps, you can correctly initialize and optimize an immutable tree-like structure in JAX while ensuring reproducibility of your random numbers.

Continuing this conversation with GPT-4o. I have some hard links, which I'd like to keep fixed at 1, and soft links which need
to be initialized and optimized against.

**ME:** Thanks, that's great! What if I have a hybrid situation, where some weights in the tree are fixed (and equal one), 
and I don't want to touch them, but I want to randomly initialize some other weights and optimize against those, in JAX? Please use Adam optimizer.

**GPT-4o:**

In a scenario where some weights in a tree-like structure are fixed and should remain unchanged, while others are initialized randomly and optimized, you can manage this by masking the fixed weights during optimization. Here's how to handle this using JAX and the Adam optimizer:

**Step-by-Step Guide**

 1. Define the Tree Structure:
     * Fixed weights are represented as 1 (or any other fixed value).
     * Optimizable weights are represented by placeholders that will be replaced with random values.

 2. Initialize the Tree:
     * Only initialize the optimizable weights with random numbers.

 3. Apply Optimization:
     * During optimization, ensure that updates are only applied to the optimizable weights, leaving the fixed weights unchanged.

Here's an example: [tree_masked_init_optimize.py](tree_masked_init_optimize.py)

**Explanation:**

 1. Tree Structure Definition:
     * The tree is defined with `1.0` for fixed weights and `None` for weights that should be optimized.

 2. Initialization:
     * The create_tree function initializes the tree. It only assigns random values to the placeholders (`None`) and leaves the fixed values (`1.0`) unchanged.

 3. Loss Function:
     * A simple loss function, like the sum of squares, is used. This can be replaced with any loss function that fits your use case.

 4. Masking:
     * The `mask_tree` function generates a mask where `True` indicates an optimizable weight and `False` indicates a fixed weight. This mask is used to zero out gradients for the fixed weights during optimization.

 5. Optimization with Adam:
     * The Adam optimizer is used, with the optimization step ensuring that only the optimizable weights are updated.

By following this approach, you ensure that the fixed weights remain untouched while the optimizable weights are initialized randomly and optimized accordingly.

**NOTE**: [tree_masked_init_optimize.py](tree_masked_init_optimize.py) is a useful prototype, but it has bugs (easy to see if one runs it)

Continuing this conversation. I complained about problems, and GPT-4o produced me a version which works
for scalar leaves (I specifically requested to handle only the case of scalar leaves):

[tree_masked_init_optimize_v2.py](tree_masked_init_optimize_v2.py) - I changed the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.1 and added a print:

```
