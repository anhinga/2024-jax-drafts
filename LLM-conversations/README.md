(On JAX immutable tree optimization and random initialization intricacies,
see also **Random numbers** section in **JAX - The Sharp Bits**, 
https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html)

[tree_init_prototype.py](tree_init_prototype.py) - a very nice LLM-generated prototype for
tree initialization with random leaves in JAX (that's what I would do too, compute
how many leaves are there, generate all the keys required by JAX way to generate
random numbers, and then use them all to initialize leaves, and then
unflatten the structure back into tree, avoiding any tree traversal and any complex logic)

For optimization of these weights it suggests using https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax library.

>To optimize the values in the tree, you can use JAX's `jax.grad` or `jax.value_and_grad` to compute gradients
>with respect to the loss function, and `jax.tree_util.tree_map` to apply updates to the tree structure.

> **Key Points to Remember:**
>
> 1. **Random Number Generation:** Always pass the rng_key explicitly to functions that generate random numbers. This ensures reproducibility.
> 2. **Immutability:** JAX data structures are immutable, so updates return new versions of the structures rather than modifying them in place.
> 3. **Tree Structures:** Use `jax.tree_util` utilities to handle tree-like structures effectively, both for initialization and optimization.
>
> By following these steps, you can correctly initialize and optimize an immutable tree-like structure in JAX while ensuring reproducibility of your random numbers.
